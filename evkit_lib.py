Key Features:
- Uses tuples `(success: bool, error_code: int, response: str)` for function returns:
    - `success`: Indicates whether the command executed successfully (`True`) or failed (`False`).
    - `error_code`: The response error code from the BLE module.
    - `response`: The raw text response received from the module.
    - Supports legacy and extended BLE advertising configurations.
    - Implements API commands for device management, including setting names, rebooting,
    and querying firmware details.
